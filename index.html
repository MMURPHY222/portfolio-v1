        <div class = "aboutText"> Hello, I am interested in a full stack developer position! 
            My name is Meghan Murphy, I have a degree in Anthropology from 
            Emory University, and a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development 
            from Georgia Tech. I am a former college athlete, outdoors lover, 
            and dog fanatic. College was a balancing act between a full course 
            load, many hours of softball practice each week, and working at the 
            Student Athletic Center, oftentimes starting my days at 5am and not 
            getting home until 9 or 10 at night. My years at Emory shaped my 
            strong work ethic, and my experiences as a competitive athlete have 
            given me the ability to communicate respectfully and effectively with 
            a team. I jump into new projects with curiosity and enthusiasm, unafraid 
            to take on a leadership role within a group, but also content to step 
            back and let others take the reigns. I love working with people from 
            diverse backgrounds and seeing different cultures and worldviews come 
            together to make a unique, multifaceted product. During my bootcamp I 
            have applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project 
            where I collaborated in a team of five to develop a multi-page MERN app 
            that allows users to post fan-fiction stories and other users to comment 
            on their posts. I am excited to bring my expertise in HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript to a collaborative team that promotes social change through 
            beautiful and responsive design. I also hope to lend my future tech 
            skills to non-profits, specifically animal shelters where I do frequent 
            volunteer work.</div>
